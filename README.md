## Marc:

### I've added the dotenv package

To get the DB working on your machine, create a file called ".env" in the root directory.

Inside it, put in your local DB credentials like so:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Error

`` wines`.`wineId` AS `wines.wineId` FROM `inventory` AS `inventory` INNER JOIN `wines` AS `wines` ON `inventory`.`id` = `wines`.`wineId` WHERE `inventory`.`user_id` = 1; ``
